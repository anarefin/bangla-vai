# üé§üìé Voice + Attachment Ticketing Feature (Refactored)

## Overview

The Voice + Attachment feature enhances the existing Bengali voice ticketing system by allowing customers to submit both voice complaints and supporting attachments (screenshots, documents, etc.) simultaneously. This creates more contextual and accurate tickets through advanced AI analysis.

**‚úÖ Refactored for simplicity:**
- **No Pillow dependency** - Gemini Vision API handles raw image bytes directly
- **Extended existing streamlit_app.py** - Uses the proven working voice complaint system
- **Simplified architecture** - Less dependencies, same functionality

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Input Processing
- **Bengali Voice Transcription**: Uses ElevenLabs Scribe API for accurate Bengali speech-to-text
- **Attachment Analysis**: Supports images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF), documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX), and text files
- **Combined AI Analysis**: Gemini Vision API analyzes both voice and visual content together using raw bytes

### 2. Enhanced AI Processing
- **Voice-Image Correlation**: AI determines how the attachment relates to the voice complaint
- **Technical Assessment**: Automatically identifies technical issues from screenshots
- **Contextual Understanding**: Combines voice context with visual evidence for better ticket categorization

### 3. Comprehensive Ticket Creation
- **Enhanced Descriptions**: AI-generated descriptions that combine voice and visual information
- **Smart Categorization**: More accurate category and priority assignment based on multiple inputs
- **Detailed Analysis**: Stores comprehensive analysis results for customer service review

### For Developers (API Usage)

```python
import requests

# Prepare files
with open("complaint.wav", "rb") as audio_file, \
     open("screenshot.png", "rb") as attachment_file:
    
    files = {
        "audio_file": ("complaint.wav", audio_file, "audio/wav"),
        "attachment_file": ("screenshot.png", attachment_file, "image/png")
    }
    
    data = {
        "customer_name": "John Doe",
        "customer_email": "john@example.com",
        "customer_phone": "+8801234567890",
        "attachment_description": "Error screenshot from mobile app"
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/process/voice-with-attachment",
        files=files,
        data=data,
        timeout=180
